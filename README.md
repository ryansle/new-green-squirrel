# GreenSquirrelNYC.com

Home of the Green Squirrel Collective - a delivery service based in Brooklyn, NY.

## Description

### Why does this exist?
Prior to this website being built, the GSC (Green Squirrel Collective) was using a photo of a menu on their Tumblr site in order to run their inventory system. As expected, this solution was difficult to maintain and very rarely kept up-to-date. 

I approached the group in late 2022 to propose a new solution: a custom-built website that utilizes a content management system in order to make it quick and easy to maintain their rotating menu. This is the second iteration of that website. The original version can be viewed [here.](https://green-squirrel.vercel.app/)
